# Project purpose
DevOps Engineer Home Challenge for @Versatile
As part of this Home assignment, I was required to create a web-app that returns Hello,<name> , deploy it automatically, test and create useful CI flow.

# Architecture

# How to use

# Artifacts

# Future work
1. enable terraform variables to choose from a drop down list, just to not always use the free tier
2. make production web-app always on and re-deploy with flag
3. fix folder structure to better visibility (ansible files, TF files, Docker files)
