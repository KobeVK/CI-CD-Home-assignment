# Project purpose
DevOps Engineer Home Challenge for @Versatile
As part of this Home assignment, I was required to create a web-app that returns Hello,<name> , deploy it automatically, test and create useful CI flow.

important notes:
1. Engineers cannot deploy to same enviorment <br>
This was done by using GIT to manage my Terraform code. It allows me to track changes to your code and manage conflicts one build at a time.
2. Links can be seen throughout the Jenkins jobs run <br>
2.1 deployed web app<br>
2.2 docker image<br>
3. Emails on failed test<br>

# Future work
1. enable terraform variables to choose from a drop down list, just to not always use the free tier
2. make production web-app always on and re-deploy with flag
3. fix folder structure to better visibility (ansible files, TF files, Docker files)
4. add proxy such as NginX
